> A samurai has no goal, only a path

It's just a joke =) 
I'm inspired by the ability to make convenient, beautiful and useful apps, 
the magic of transforming symbols on the screen into a functioning project. 
The created product and the environment (people) are important for me. 
And the goal is to be able to make it qualitatively.

Knowledge of __English__ _pre-intermediate_.
